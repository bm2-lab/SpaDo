## Overview
SpatialAlign is designed for multi-slice spatial domain analysis of both single-cell and spot-resolution spatial transcriptomics.

From the view of biological function, SpaAlign uses a simple but effective strategy, spatially adjacent cell type distribution, to integrate gene expression and spatial information, that enables multi-slice spatial domain analysis from three aspects, namely consistent spatial domain detection, reference-based spatial domain annotation, and slice-level clustering and trajectory analysis with spatial domain composition.
