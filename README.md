## Overview
With the rapid advancements in spatial transcriptome sequencing, multiple tissue slices are now available, enabling the integration and interpretation of spatial cellular landscapes. Herein, we introduce SpaDo, a tool for multi-slice spatial domain analysis, including modules for multi-slice spatial domain detection, reference-based annotation, and multiple slice clustering at both single-cell and spot resolutions. We demonstrate SpaDo's effectiveness with over 40 multi-slice spatial transcriptome datasets from 7 sequencing platforms. Our findings highlight SpaDo's potential to reveal novel biological insights in multi-slice spatial transcriptomes.

## Update (2024.9.4)
* **(1)** We updated [Tutorials](https://www.jianguoyun.com/p/DW15NecQnMvoCxji45QFIAA) by adding a new example(Multiple slice vs Single slice) to facilitate the reproduction of Supplementary Figure S7 in our SpaDo paper.

## Update (2024.8.9)
* **(1)** SpaDo was originally built on **Seurat 4.0.4** and **SeuratObject 4.0.4**. To avoid problems due to Seurat updates, We recently (2024.8.9) updated SpaDo to ensure compatibility with **Seurat v5**;
* **(2)** Enabling parallel execution for the **"DistributionDistance"** function when using the "JSD" distance metric, significantly reducing runtime;
* **(3)** We updated corresponding [Tutorials](https://www.jianguoyun.com/p/DW15NecQnMvoCxji45QFIAA).

## Installation
* **SpaDo** package can be installed from Github using **devtools** packages with **R>=4.0.5**.

    ```r
    library(devtools)
    install_github("bm2-lab/SpaDo")
    ```
